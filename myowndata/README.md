## MyOwnData
MyOwnData connects people who want to help with medical researchers who need data. The biggest difference with existing platforms is that we approach the problem fromt the side of the people who want to help cure a disease. MyOwnData has 2 roles: Organizer and users/patients.

With the MyOwnData marketplace the organizer can create their studies and surveys and set the questions, rewards etc. With the MyOwnData app, peoople can download a user-friendly app to survey and join studies.

MyOwnData helps each user and organizer to keep touch everyday. On MyOwnData the organizer can check how many people have contributed and what their answers are. MyOwnData provides chart analysis options for the organizer to keep updated with better understanding.

For MyOwnData, we are using Tron to store user's details, study details, Rewards details (for each Study), Survey, Audiences, Contributors and retirieving those in our website.
